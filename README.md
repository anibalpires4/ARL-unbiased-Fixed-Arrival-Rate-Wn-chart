# ARL-unbiased-Wn-chart
This R code implements ARL-unbiased Wn (with fixed arrival rate, fixed service rate and proportional changes in arrival and service rates) control charts for monitoring Ek/M/1 and M/Ek/1 queueing systems. It provides functions to compute ARL with and without randomization and create ARL profiles, allowing the detection of control limits and randomization probabilities in queueing systems. The code also includes interactive plotting via Shiny.
